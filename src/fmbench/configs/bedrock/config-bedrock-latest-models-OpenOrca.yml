# This is the evaluation parameter configurations. Initialize
# the embeddings model used to calculate quantitative metrics such as 
# cosine similarity here. The other part of this evaluation is using subjective
# evaluation methods: Max voting and Average pooling. In the case of when a ground truth
# is provided, FMBench can use max voting between a 'panel of judges' to get a verdict [correct, incorrect].
# In other cases for more subjective evaluations, FMBench uses average pooling, to get the average
# rating from each judge of the panel on each response and get the average ratings from all on one model
# and so on. For more information, view this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18796

  # We construct a PoLL from a panel of LLM judges being drawn from disparate model families. We consider two
  # different voting functions for aggregating scores across the judges. For tasks where ground truth is provided, we use
  # max voting, as all judgements are binary [correct, incorrect]. For Chatbot Arena we instead use average 
  # pooling because judgements are scores ranging from 1-5 and a three judge panel often does not produce 
  # a clear majority decision
  PoLL_Composition_and_Voting: 
    # If you are looking to evaluate the model responses 
    # to corresponding sources of ground truth, then FMBench

    # process
