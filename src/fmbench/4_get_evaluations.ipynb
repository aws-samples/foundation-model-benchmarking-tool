    "## Get Evaluations on inferences generated by candidate models in the inference step, gather findings on quantitative metrics (such as _Cosine Similarity, levenshtein distance, and token set ratio_) and subjective metrics on various criteria using Max Voting & Average Pooling with PoLL (Panel of LLM Evaluators)\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "*This notebook works best with the conda_python3 kernel on a ml.t3.medium machine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This step of the solution focusses on getting evaluations on the quality of responses. It does so by gathering the following information and performing the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gets the inference request file that contains all inferences from the inference step**: This step first accesses and gets all the inference request file into a dataframe which contains the responses from the candidate models, ground truth (if any), and other information, such as the source payload file, concurrency level, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generates quantitative metrics for evaluation**: Calculate quantitative metrics to measure similarity and accuracy, for example _Cosine Similarity, levenshtein distance, and token set ratio_. This helps in getting a quantitative overall score to the entire dataset in terms of which model generates outputs that are most similar and accurate to the ground truth (if any is provided). We use these metrics to build a hierarchy evaluation decision tree to move up to the next step of evaluation if the correctness of an answer is not obviously determined. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The steps that are followed as a part of this evaluation hierarchy (for Max Voting) is as given below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. For this, we check if either the _Cosine Similarity, levenshtein similarity, or token set ratio_ values exceed a given threshold, and if they do, we assume that the answer to the question is correct and do not parse it through the next step. This saves on latency, cost, and also acts as an evaluation filter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. For the rest of the answers that are not obviously correct or do not have any semantic relation with the ground truth, we move to the next step in the hierarchical tree, which is using a panel of LLM evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uses a _Panel of LLM Evaluator_ approach to get subjective evaluations**: Refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18796). We use the following ways to evaluate the responses from the `candidate models` (models used to generate inferences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Max Voting**: When a dataset provides a ground truth, we use a technique called `Max Voting`. Here, we use PoLL, or a panel of LLM evaluators, from different model families to evaluate each candidate model's response based on whether it generates a `correct` or an `incorrect` answer simply based on its comparison with the ground truth. Using models from different families as a PoLL, increases it's evaluation ability to be close to that of a human evaluation, and eliminates intra model bias during the evaluation process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. **Average Pooling**: When a dataset does not provide a ground truth, or if a task being evaluated needs to be given deeper subjective level judgements, that is when we use `Average Pooling`. In this, we use specific subjective level criteria and then evaluate the candidate model responses on a scale of 1-5 for each PoLL. Using this, we get an average score on each criteria and then can evaluate how each candidate model was scored based on the PoLL evaluations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "FMBench uses this approach of PoLL to eradicate intra model bias by using models as judges from different model families. This brings the evaluation results closer to that of a human evaluation, makes the evaluation process more streamlined, consistent across all the responses, and reduces the latency and cost of evaluating the candidate models over time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "***All evaluations are generated in a JSON format for further downstream analytics on the evaluation results***"

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this portion of the notebook, we run evaluations on the content generated by different candidate models. We use two main evaluation methods: `Max Voting` and `Average Pooling`. To eliminate intra-model bias, we address this by scoring answer correctness based not on a single judge, but instead on a panel composed of multiple evaluator models. Similar pooling techniques are used to reduce variance in human annotations by normalizing out both natural variation in human judgements caused by their own subjective biases as well as human error. We use the following two techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Max Voting**: We use the PoLL to evaluate candidate model responses by checking its correctness compared to a provided ground truth answer in the dataset. We prompt each PoLL to evaluate and give the response in a JSON structure, giving a verdict on whether the response is correct or incorrect, and an explanation as to why that is. Using this, we can perform downstream analytics such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Calculate the overall accuracy of each model using the correct versus the (correct + incorrect) responses\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Calculate the `error rate` or frequency or incorrect responses\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Categorize the errors based on the explanations provided by the evaluators. Common categories might include misunderstanding the question, incomplete answers, factual inaccuracies\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Summary of overall correct/incorrect, and the best model based on the PoLL. Rank the models on Correctness versus Incorrectness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Average Pooling**: We use the PoLL to rate the response of each candidate model on a more subjective criteria. Here, we have the candidate model responses rated on a scale of 1-5 based on the subjective criteria and then get an explanation to that. Using this we can do as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Calculate the average score for each model across all questions to get an overall performance measure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Compute the standard deviation of the scores to understand the consistency of the model's performance."

    "In this portion of the step, FMBench performs the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the method of evaluation is `Max Voting`, then in that case we suppose that a ground truth to the question from the context or task is pre existing in the dataset. We first calculate quantitative metrics. If the desired correctness threshold for either of the cosine similarity, levenshtein distance or token set ratio is exceeded, we end the evaluation of that data and move to the next one. If none of the quantitative metrics satisfy the threshold, the data moves to the panel of LLM evaluators for next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use the LLM panel of judges (in this case 3 judges), to give a verdict on whether the `answer` from the candidate models during inference is `correct` or `incorrect`. If the response is correct, then it gives it a `correct` and if not, then `incorrect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the method of evaluation is `Average Pooling`, then in that case we suppose that the completion from the candidate models are supposed to be evlauated on a more subjective criteria rather than just deciding whether it is correct or incorrect compared to the ground truth. In this case, the average pooling prompt templates are used by the Judge Panel to give a rating out of 1-5 to each model completion on different criteria, such as relevancy, helpfulness, correctness, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each model response is given in a JSON structure which is further used for downstream analytics, to decide the comparision of evaluation results between different model candidates and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "***This step takes about ~6 minutes to complete. Model completion time depends on the PoLL models being used. `Llama3-70b`, `Cohere command-r-v1` and `claude 3 haiku` were used for this example***"
