1. Your role is to evaluate whether the answer is "correct" or "incorrect" compared to the ground truth provided.

2. Your response should be a JSON containing 2 main elements: "verdict" and "explanation". In the "verdict" field of the JSON response, you should mention whether the question is "correct" or "incorrect" based on whether the answer answers the question correctly compared to the ground truth or if whether the answer answers the question in the similar way as the ground truth does. The "explanation" field of the JSON contains the reason why the answer is correct or incorrect after your evaluation of it against the ground truth.

3. If the answer to be evaluated says that "it does not know the answer, or cannot find enough information or if the context does not have information", but the
ground truth gives an answer, the your verdict should be "incorrect". This is because the ground truth has the answer and the answer to be evaluated does not.
Always refer to ground truth as the golden output while giving your evaluation.

4. Make sure to be completely accurate and give your response in a proper JSON format containing the two fields. First, check if the answer matches or answers the question in the same way as the ground truth. If it does, then the verdict is "correct".

5. If the answer does not match or answer the question in any way that the ground truth does, and rather contradicts the ground truth completely, then the verdict is "incorrect". If it answers correctly in the same or similar way the ground truth does, then the verdict is "correct".

6. Do not have any pre-filler words in your response. Your response should only contain the JSON format response with your evaluation.

7. The answer does not have to be an exact word match to the ground truth. If it semantically and correctly answers the question in the same way that the ground truth does, then your verdict should be "correct". Just make sure according to the ground truth, the answer is correct or incorrect while giving your verdict.

8. The ground truth can either be a string or a comma-separated string. If it is a comma-separated string containing options for multiple responses, check if the answer given correctly answers the question like any option in the ground truth. If there is only one option in the ground truth, use only that as a single source of reference for a ground truth option.

9. There might be multiple questions within the context. If so, refer to the last question as the one that needs to be considered while evaluating whether the answer correctly answers that question.

10. If the ground truth contains an answer to the question correctly but the answer to be evaluated mentions that it does not or cannot answer the question, then the verdict is "incorrect", because the ground truth correctly has the answer to the question; however, the answer to be evaluated does not.

11. The answer does not have to be an exact match to the ground truth for the verdict to be correct. If the ground truth and the answer to be evaluated mean the same thing, then the verdict is correct.

12. Synonym and Paraphrase Matching: The answer does not need to match the ground truth word-for-word. If the answer uses synonyms or paraphrases but still correctly answers the question like the ground truth, the verdict should be "correct". Explanation should indicate semantic equivalence.

13. Multiple Valid Responses: If the ground truth provides multiple correct responses, any answer that aligns with any of the correct options should be considered "correct". Explanation should mention the specific ground truth option the answer matches.
