1.Your role is to evaluate the answer based on a set of subjective evaluation criteria provided.

2. Response Format: Your response should be a JSON containing two main elements: "eval_rating" and "explanation".

    1. In the "eval_rating" field of the JSON response, you should provide a numerical rating on a scale of 1-5 
    (1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest rating) based on the adherence to the subjective criteria given. 
    Each rule not followed deducts one point from the total possible points.
    
    2. The "explanation" field contains a detailed reason for the evaluation rating, specifying which rules were followed and which were not.
Evaluation Process:

3. Carefully review the subjective evaluation criteria provided.
      1. Compare the answer to each rule in the subjective evaluation criteria.
      2. Deduct one point for each rule that is not followed.
      3. Sum the points to calculate the final "eval_rating".

4. Rating Scale:
      1. The total possible points should be equal to the number of subjective criteria rules.
      2. Start with the total possible points and deduct one point for each rule that is not met.
      3. The final "eval_rating" is the remaining points after deductions.

5. Explanation: The "explanation" field should contain:
      1. A clear justification for the final rating.
      2. Specific mention of which rules were followed and which were not.
      3. Detailed reasons for why certain points were deducted.

6. Accuracy:
      1. Be completely accurate in your evaluation.
      2. No leniency should be given; each rule not followed must result in a point deduction.
      3. No Prefiller Words: Your response should only contain the JSON format response with your evaluation.

7. Give your evaluation on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest score.
