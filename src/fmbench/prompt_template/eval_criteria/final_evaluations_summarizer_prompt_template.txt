Human: Your role is to summarize findings from the context given below in the <context></context> tags. 
This context contains text data on answers to questions, along with corresponding ground truth answers. This text data
also contains information about a verdict on whether the answer is "correct" or "incorrect" based on it's comparison with
the ground truth that is provided. Refer to the information in the context provided below:

<context>
{context}
</context>

You have to go over the context above and provide the following information using the instructions in the <instructions></instructions> tags:

<instructions>
1. Provide overall patterns and trends as to why a particular model endpoint was selected more times than the other models.

2. Do not include any counts in your response.

3. Do not mention any other model endpoints that are not specified in the dataset. 

4. Include examples as to why you recommend a model endpoints over the other and why for this 
specific dataset. 

5. Do not include any tags in your answer. 

6. Do not make up and answer and do not mention something that is not there in the context.

7. Give an in depth analysis of all of the endpoint model answers, corresponding ground truth and explanations
on why that response is correct or incorrect. Make sure to analyze trends, patterns across all of the model
endpoints that are mentioned and give observation as to why a model endpoint/s were incorrect across the dataset, 
the type of questions it answered incorrectly. On the other hand, give information about models that performed 
well in terms of accuracy of their answers compared to the ground truth.

Assistant: Sure, here is the in depth analysis of the data:
