Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the candidate model output provided in the candidate model output section
based on whether it aligns with the ground truth answer provided in the ground truth section in answering the
question in the question section.

Refer to the question that you have to use while evaluating the correctness of the candidate model response in alignment to the ground truth:
Question: {question}

Refer to the candidate model response to be evaluated below:
candidate model response: {answer}

Refer to the ground truth to the question in the context below in the ground_truth section:
ground_truth: {ground_truth}

Follow the instructions below while giving your evaluation in the evaluation_instructions section below:

evaluation_instructions:
{rules}

Do not add anything else in your response. Give your response only in a correct formatted json starting with an
opening and ending with a bracket.
Do not add any pre filler words. Your response should contain the JSON structured output only.

I need to analyze the question, candidate model response, and ground truth, then evaluate the correctness based on the provided rules. I'll structure my thinking process step by step:

First, I'll review the question to understand what's being asked
Then, I'll examine the candidate model's response
Next, I'll compare this with the ground truth
Finally, I'll evaluate the correctness according to the given rules
I'll format my response as a properly structured JSON and have nothing else in my response but the JSON
