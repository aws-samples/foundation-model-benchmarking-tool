This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.\n\nAs growth proceeds, the column of cells may divide or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. In many glands, the number of branches is limited, in others (salivary, pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division. As a rule, the branches do not unite with one another, but in one instance, the liver, this does occur when a reticulated compound gland is produced. In compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch, and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell.\n\nGlands are classified according to their shape.\n* If the gland retains its shape as a tube throughout it is termed a tubular gland.\n* In the second main variety of gland the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumen variously increased in size. These are termed alveolar or saccular glands.\n\nFunction\n\nGlands are divided based on their function into two groups:\n\nEndocrine glands\n\nEndocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the blood stream. These glands that secrete their products through the basal lamina into the blood stream and lack a duct system. These glands often secrete hormones, and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. The pineal gland, thymus gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands.\n\nExocrine glands\n \n\nExocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer surface of the body, such as the skin or the human gastrointestinal tract. Secretion is directly onto the apical surface. The glands in this group can be divided into three groups:\n* Apocrine glands a portion of the secreting cell's body is lost during secretion. Apocrine gland is often used to refer to the apocrine sweat glands, however it is thought that apocrine sweat glands may not be true apocrine glands as they may not use the apocrine method of secretion. e.g. mammery gland, sweat gland of arm pit, pubic region, skin around anus, lips, nipples.\n* Holocrine glands the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its substances (e.g., sebaceous glands)sebaceous, meibomiun & zeis gland.\n* Merocrine glands cells secrete their substances by exocytosis (e.g., mucous and serous glands). Also called \"eccrine\". e.g. max sweat gland of humans, goblet cells, salivary gland, tear gland, intestinal glands.\n\nThe type of secretory product of exocrine glands may also be one of three categories:\n* Serous glands secrete a watery, often protein-rich, fluid-like product, e.g. sweat glands.\n* Mucous glands secrete a viscous product, rich in carbohydrates (such as glycoproteins), e.g. goblet cells.\n* Sebaceous glands secrete a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and meibomian glands.\n\nClinical significance\n\nOther animals\n\nAdditional images\n\n Image:Gray1025.png|Section of submaxillary gland of kitten.

In English-speaking countries it is generally known as \"Here Comes the Bride\" or \"Wedding March\", though \"wedding march\" refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride, notably Felix Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\". The piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858. \n\nThe chorus is sung in Lohengrin by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony, as they accompany the heroine Elsa to the bridal chamber.\n\nText\n\nAlthough at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without vocal singing, in Lohengrin the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three.\n\nEight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody.\n\nThe chorus then repeats the first section, gradually proceeding offstage.\n\nReligious attitudes \n\nMany pastors of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod oppose the \"Bridal Chorus\" because of both pre-First World War Lutheran opposition to the theater and the pagan elements of Wagner's operas.  The Roman Catholic Church generally does not use the \"Bridal Chorus\"; one diocese's guidelines regarding the chorus states that the chorus is a secular piece of music, that it is not a processional to the altar in the opera, and especially that its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship.  The song is also not used in Eastern Orthodox weddings.\nQuestion:\nWhich composer wrote the \u2018Bridal Chorus\u2019, popularly known as \u2018Here Comes the Bride\u2019?\nAnswer:\nWagner's\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nJohn Glenn Returns to Space - The New York Times\nJohn Glenn Returns to Space\n\ufffd Photo Essay (11 photos)\nJohn Glenn Returns to Space\nThirty-six years after he rode a cramped Mercury capsule to become the first American to orbit Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962, and 24 years after the trajectory of fame landed him in the U.S. Senate, John Glenn  suited up again as an astronaut. On Oct. 29, 1998, at the age of 77, he became the oldest person ever to fly in space, a hero of the Cold War stepping forward this time as a role model for the geriatric generation -- and to satisfy an unending yearning.\nQuestion:\nIn 1998 at the age of 77 who became the oldest person to fly in space?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
