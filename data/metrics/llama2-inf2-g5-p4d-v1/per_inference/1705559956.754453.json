Little is known about his personal life prior to his role in the Portuguese Age of Discovery, and was considered a household servant and shield-bearer of the Infante Henry the Navigator. He was a native of Lagos on which he based his sea voyages, in the southern Algarve.  \n\nHe joined the service of Prince Henry's expeditions in 1433, when the Infante entrusted him with a vessel and crew, in order to attempt to round Cape Bojador, an impassable cape, with the then level of knowledge and equipment.  Sailing from Lagos, Portugal, Eanes made an unknown number of voyages along the west coast of Africa, before being driven west towards the Canary Islands.  In the islands he captured some inoffensive natives and returned with them as captives to Sagres, excusing his failure by recounting the dangers of the trip. His return was greeted with reserve and coldness in the court of Prince Henry, who had expected the navigator to succeed in rounding the Cape. Eanes hoped to return to favour in the following year, if the Prince would favour him with a second expedition. In 1434, his barquentine-caravel and crew was able to sail beyond Cape Bojador and return to Sagres, reporting the conditions of the water, land and ease of navigation beyond the Cape, and bringing with him some wild roses to prove that they had succeeded in their expedition.  The discovery of a passable route around Cape Bojador marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of Africa. \n\nEanes made another voyage, with Afonso Gon\u00e7alves Baldaia, in 1435. They sailed about 30 leagues (144\u00a0km), or even 50 leagues (240\u00a0km) south of Cape Bojador and reached the African coast. Although they did not discover any inhabitants immediately, they did find traces of a human presence, during a voyage that was considered favourable. They named the bay in which they anchored Angra dos Ruivos (Cove of Reds), for the abundance of fish (resembling gurnets) that they caught in the waters.\nQuestion:\nIn 1434, Portuguese mariner Gil Eanes made a major breakthrough to obtain a reliable trade route to Western and Eastern Africa and India by finding a route around which cape?\nAnswer:\nCabo Bojador\nPassage:\nWebb Ellis Cup\nThe Webb Ellis Cup is the trophy awarded to the winner of the Rugby World Cup, the premier competition in men's international rugby union. The Cup is named after William Webb Ellis, who is often credited as the inventor of rugby football. The trophy is silver gilt and has been presented to the winner of the Rugby World Cup since the first competition in 1987. It has been held thrice by New Zealand (1987, 2011 & 2015), twice by Australia (1991 & 1999) and South Africa (1995 & 2007), and once by  England in 2003.\n\nThe 38 centimetre trophy weighs 4.5 kg, is gilded silver and is supported by two cast scroll handles.  On one handle there is a head of a satyr, on the other there is the head of a nymph. On the face of the trophy, the words International Rugby Football Board and below that arch The Webb Ellis Cup are engraved. The Webb Ellis Cup is also referred to (incorrectly) as the \"Webb Ellis Trophy\" or colloquially as \"Bill\", a nickname coined by the 1991 Rugby World Cup winners, the Wallabies.\n\nHistory\n\nThere are two official Webb Ellis Cups, which are used interchangeably. One cup is a 1906 trophy made by Carrington and Co. of London, which was a Victorian design of a 1740s cup by Paul de Lamerie, while the other is a 1986 replica.\n\nJohn Kendall-Carpenter, former England forward and the organiser of the first Rugby World Cup and Bob Weighill, the secretary of the International Rugby Board also a former England forward, visited Garrard & Co, the crown jeweller in Regent Street, London. Director Richard Jarvis, brought the particular cup down from the vault and showed it to both of them.\n\nIt was chosen for use in February 1987. Ronnie Dawson of Ireland, Keith Rowlands of Wales, Bob Stuart and  Dick Littlejohn of New Zealand and the Australians Nick Shehadie and Ross Turnbull approved of the choice of the trophy.  The trophy is being cared for and restored after each game by silversmiths Thomas Lyte.  \n\nIt was soon named \"The Webb Ellis Cup\". New Zealand became the first nation to win the Webb Ellis Cup when they won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. The Webb Ellis Cup has been held by four nations; New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.\n\nThe current holders are New Zealand after beating Australia 34\u201317 in the 2015 Final in England. The trophy was on display in Newlands, South Africa until 2007, where it had stayed for two years following their victory. Later it was returned to the home of World Rugby, Ireland. One cup recently went on tour around the New Zealand provinces along with the Dave Gallaher Trophy, Bledisloe Cup, Hillary Shield, Women's World Cup, Rugby Sevens World Series and the Junior World Cup trophies.\nQuestion:\nFrom 2011 to 2019 who are the holders of the William Webb Ellis Cup?\nAnswer:\nN Z\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nWhat does cowcatcher mean? - Definitions.net\nWhat does cowcatcher mean?\nThis page provides all possible meanings and translations of the word cowcatcher\nPrinceton's WordNet(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition:\nfender, buffer, cowcatcher, pilot(noun)\nan inclined metal frame at the front of a locomotive to clear the track\nWiktionary(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition:\ncowcatcher(Noun)\nThe V-shaped device on the front of a locomotive (or other large vehicle) shaped so as to push objects on the tracks out of the way, to prevent major damage to the train.\nNumerology\nThe numerical value of cowcatcher in Chaldean Numerology is: 3\nPythagorean Numerology\nQuestion:\nOn what would you find a Cowcatcher?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
