The criteria that a sexual position must meet in order to be considered part of the nothing but net category is rigidly defined as any position such that only genitals are touching.\nPaying homage to its namesake, it is considered top form to make a \"swish\" sound at the outset of a nothing but net position. Neglecting to \"swish\" at adequate volume greatly increases risk of penile fracture.\nFor a couple containing a male that is not well endowed, it is likely that only limited exploration of the nothing but net category will take place due to anatomical restrictions only permitting a just the tip (or JT squared) scenario.\nFucking in the airplane bathroom, we had to hold the walls so tight it was nothing but net.\nQuestion:\n\"In basketball, what word means \"\"nothing but net\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nSwish\nPassage:\nBematist\nBematists or bematistae (Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af, from \n\u03b2\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1 bema 'pace'), were specialists in ancient Greece who were trained to measure distances by counting their steps. \nMeasurements of Alexander's bematists\n\nBematists accompanied Alexander the Great on his campaign in Asia. Their measurements of the distances traveled by Alexander's army show a high degree of precision to the point that it had been suggested that they must have used an odometer, although there is no direct mentioning of such a device: \n\n \n\nThe table below lists distances of the routes as measured by two of Alexander's bematists, Diognetus and Baeton. They were recorded in Pliny's Naturalis Historia  (NH 6.61\u201362). Another similar set of measurements is given by Strabo (11.8.9) following Eratosthenes.   \n\nNotes:\n1) 1 mille passus = 1,480 meters or 1,618.5 yards \n2) 1 Attic stadion =  606\u201910\u2019\u2019 \n3) The route is not recorded to have been followed by Alexander himself.\n\nAddenda: Leaving out the highest outlier each, the average deviation of the rest of the bematists's measurements would be 1.9% with Pliny and 1.5% with Strabo at a measured distance of 1,958 respectively 1,605 miles.\n\nList of bematists \n\n* Amyntas \n* Baeton\n* Diognetus\n* Philonides of Chersonissos\nQuestion:\nIn ancient Greece, the bematists who accompanied Alexander the Great on his campaigns were trained to measure what?\nAnswer:\nDistances (by counting their steps)\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nMary Queen of Scots beheaded - Feb 08, 1587 - HISTORY.com\nMary Queen of Scots beheaded - Feb 08, 1587 - HISTORY.com\nMary Queen of Scots beheaded\nShare this:\nMary Queen of Scots beheaded\nAuthor\nMary Queen of Scots beheaded\nURL\nPublisher\nA+E Networks\nAfter 19 years of imprisonment, Mary Queen of Scots is beheaded at Fotheringhay Castle in England for her complicity in a plot to murder Queen Elizabeth I.\nIn 1542, while just six days old, Mary ascended to the Scottish throne upon the death of her father, King James V. Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis\u2019 death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country\u2019s monarch.\nIn 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth\u2019s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o\u2019 Field, and Mary\u2019s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.\nIn 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.\nOn February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother\u2019s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth\u2019s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nAt which castle was Mary Queen of Scots beheaded?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
