If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n<</SYS>>\n\n```\nPassage 1:\nHuernia\nThe genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587\u20131653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.\n\nSpecies\nThe follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\nformerly includedmoved to Angolluma\n\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri\nPassage 2:\nDictyosperma\nDictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, R\u00e9union and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.\n\nDescription\nThe ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax\u2014 which has given the palm its epithet album\u2014 and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 \u2013 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.\nOn flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.\nThree varieties are currently recognized:\n\nDictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, R\u00e9union\nDictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island\nDictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Gu\u00e9ho - 2 remaining specimens on \u00cele Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLiving in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.\n\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on \u00cele Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on \u00cele Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island's endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.\n```\n\nQuestion: Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
