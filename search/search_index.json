In order to determine if an LLM generated response matches the ground truth we ask other LLMs called the evaluator LLMs to compare the LLM output and the ground truth and provide a verdict if the LLM generated ground truth is correct or not given the ground truth. Here is the link to the Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet model prompt being used as an evaluator (or a judge model). A combination of the cosine similarity and the LLM evaluator verdict decides if the LLM generated response is correct or incorrect.

Check out all the latest and greatest features from FMBench on the FMBench website.</p> <p>Support for Model Evaluations: FMBench now adds support for evaluating candidate models using Majority Voting with a Panel of LLM Evaluators. Customers can now use FMBench to evaluate model accuracy across open-source and custom datasets, thus FMBench now enables customers to not only measure performance (inference latency, cost, throughput) but also model accuracy.</p> <p>Native support for LLM compilation and deployment on AWS Silicon: FMBench now supports end-to-end compilation and model deployment on AWS Silicon. Customers no longer have to wait for models to be available for AWS Chips via SageMaker JumpStart and neither do they have to go through the process of compiling the model to Neuron themselves, FMBench does it all for them. We can simply put the relevant configuration options in the FMBench config file and it will compile and deploy the model on SageMaker (config) or EC2 (config).</p> <p>Website for better user experience: FMBench has a website now along with an introduction video. The website is fully searchable to ease common tasks such as installation, finding the right config file, benchmarking on various hosting platforms (EC2, EKS, Bedrock, Neuron, Docker), model evaluation, etc. This website was created based on feedback from several internal teams and external customers.</p> <p>Native support for all AWS generative AI services: FMBench now benchmarks and evaluates any Foundation Model (FM) deployed on any AWS Generative AI service, be it Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon EKS, or Amazon EC2. We initially built FMBench for SageMaker, and later extended it to Bedrock and then based on customer requests extended it to support models on EKS and EC2 as well.

Support for bring your own dataset will be added soon.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Download the different files specified in the LongBench dataset into the <code>source_data</code> directory. Following is a good list to get started with:</p> <ul> <li><code>2wikimqa</code></li> <li><code>hotpotqa</code></li> <li><code>narrativeqa</code></li> <li><code>triviaqa</code></li> </ul> <p>Store these files in the <code>source_data</code> directory.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Prompt Template Directory: Create a <code>prompt_template</code> directory that contains a <code>prompt_template.txt</code> file. This <code>.txt</code> file contains the prompt template that your specific model supports. <code>FMBench</code> already supports the prompt template compatible with <code>Llama</code> models.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scripts Directory: <code>FMBench</code> also supports a <code>bring your own script (BYOS)</code> mode for deploying models that are not natively available via SageMaker JumpStart i.e. anything not included in this list. Here are the steps to use BYOS.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a Python script to deploy your model on a SageMaker endpoint. This script needs to have a <code>deploy</code> function that <code>2_deploy_model.ipynb</code> can invoke. See <code>p4d_hf_tgi.py</code> for reference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place your deployment script in the <code>scripts</code> directory in your read bucket. If your script deploys a model directly from HuggingFace and needs to have access to a HuggingFace auth token, then create a file called <code>hf_token.txt</code> and put the auth token in that file. The <code>.gitignore</code> file in this repo has rules to not commit the <code>hf_token.txt</code> to the repo. Today, <code>FMBench</code> provides inference scripts for:</p> <ul> <li>All SageMaker Jumpstart Models</li> <li>Text-Generation-Inference (TGI) container supported models</li> <li>Deep Java Library DeepSpeed container supported models</li> </ul> <p>Deployment scripts for the options above are available in the scripts directory, you can use these as reference for creating your own deployment scripts as well.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Tokenizer Directory: Place the <code>tokenizer.json</code>, <code>config.json</code> and any other files required for your model's tokenizer in the <code>tokenizer</code> directory. The tokenizer for your model should be compatible with the <code>tokenizers</code> package. <code>FMBench</code> uses <code>AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained</code> to load the tokenizer.     &gt;As an example, to use the <code>Llama 2 Tokenizer</code> for counting prompt and generation tokens for the <code>Llama 2</code> family of models: Accept the License here: meta approval form and download the <code>tokenizer.json</code> and <code>config.json</code> files from Hugging Face website and place them in the <code>tokenizer</code> directory.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Write bucket: All prompt payloads, model endpoint and metrics generated by <code>FMBench</code> are stored in this bucket. <code>FMBench</code> requires write permissions to store the results in this bucket. No directory structure needs to be pre-created in this bucket, everything is created by <code>FMBench</code> at runtime.</p> <p>```{.bash} s3://     \u251c\u2500\u2500      \u251c\u2500\u2500 /data     \u251c\u2500\u2500 /data/metrics     \u251c\u2500\u2500 /data/models     \u251c\u2500\u2500 /data/prompts ````"}]}
