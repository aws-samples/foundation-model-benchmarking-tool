A key challenge with FMs is the ability to benchmark their performance in terms of inference latency, throughput and cost so as to determine which model running with what combination of the hardware and serving stack provides the best price-performance combination for a given workload.

Stated as **business problem**, the ask is “_*What is the dollar cost per transaction for a given generative AI workload that serves a given number of users while keeping the response time under a target threshold?*_”

But to really answer this question, we need to answer an **engineering question** (an optimization problem, actually) corresponding to this business problem: “*_What is the minimum number of instances N, of most cost optimal instance type T, that are needed to serve a workload W while keeping the average transaction latency under L seconds?_*”

*W: = {R transactions per-minute, average prompt token length P, average generation token length G}*

This foundation model benchmarking tool (a.k.a. `FMBench`) is a tool to answer the above engineering question and thus answer the original business question about how to get the best price performance for a given workload. Here is one of the plots generated by `FMBench` to help answer the above question (_the instance types in the legend have been blurred out on purpose, you can find them in the actual plot generated on running `FMBench`_).
